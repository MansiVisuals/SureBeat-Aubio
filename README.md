SureBeat by Mansi Visuals

SureBeat is a Lua-based plugin for DaVinci Resolve, designed to help creators sync their videos to audio by detecting transients and adding markers directly on the audio clip. 

By leveraging Aubio for transient and tempo detection, and FFmpeg for audio conversion, SureBeat streamlines beat-syncing workflows for DaVinci Resolve users.

Features:
```
 •	Transient Detection: Automatically detects audio transients and marks them on your timeline.
 •	Tempo Detection: Analyzes audio tempo and places markers based on BPM.
 •	File Conversion: Supports various audio formats (e.g., .wav, .mp3, .flac, .aac, .ogg) through FFmpeg.
 •	Easy Integration: Seamlessly integrates with DaVinci Resolve.
```
